# Project Development

For general information about contributing changes, see the
[Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/titan-data/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is a very simple docker image, if you need to update it then just
edit the file and submit a PR to update master. That will kick off a new
Docker build via docker hub.
